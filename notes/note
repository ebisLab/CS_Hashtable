bad characteristics of hashing function => loosing data => 
                                            determenistic same number comes out everytime
                                            too many collisions

                                            wasting half the table

                                we need even distributions

advantages of binary table vs hash table:
            speed?
            collisions
            code simplicity
            sorting before starting ==> you have to do that on binary search

            trade off speed for memory => hash i have to allocate more memory ahead of time. 
            there's no key converstions for binary trees
